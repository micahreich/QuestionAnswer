# Dynamic Memory Network for QA Systems
### Introduction
I created this project to showcase the abilities of deep neural networks with regard to natural language processing tasks such as question-answering systems. 
This project was created for educational purposes only and is by no means perfect. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at micahreich02@gmail.com

### Deep Neural Networks
Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. The patterns they recognize are numerical, contained in vectors, into which all real-world data, be it images, sound, text or time series, must be translated.
